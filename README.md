# Hi there! 👋 I'm Sameh, but you can call me Simz.

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🚀 I'm passionate about tech, programming, and data analysis. 
I've been working in a shipping line the past 18 years, have climbed the ladder till I became a Customer Experience Manager, but since the company was closing, I thought I would persue my old dream.
Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of full stack web development, with a focus on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

## 🔧 What I have learned till now

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css,react,nodejs,mongodb,php,linux,mysql)](https://skillicons.dev)


## 🌱 What I'm currently learning

After finishing MERN stack course, I'm currently learining PHP, afterwards, will learn Next.js & TypeScript.

## ⏭ What's next

I don't know! may be I will try freelancing, may be I'll look for a job first to train more. I'm focusing on learning right now, then I'll try to create some projects.
wish me luck!

## 🚀 My Projects

I'm still a learner, but coming to that asap!
