# Hi there! 👋 I'm Sameh, but you can call me Simz.

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🚀 I'm passionate about tech, programming, and data analysis. 
I've been working in a shipping line the past 18 years, have climbed the ladder till I became a Customer Experience Manager, but since the company was closing, I thought I would persue my old dream.
Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of full stack web development, with a focus on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

## 🔧 What I have learned till now

## 🌱 What I'm currently learning

## ⏭ What's next

wish me luck!
